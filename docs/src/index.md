# Overview

This repository contains a suite of applications for testing different linear
     algebra routines for:

- Solving consistent linear systems
- Solving least squares problems
- Approximating subspaces of matrices

The problems that are implemented include:

    No problems are implemented yet.

# Packages

- `LAModels` implements a standard for encapsulating different linear algebra 
    problems in this package. It provides testing capability that ensures a 
    minimum working interface. See [Linear Algebra Models](@ref) for more
    information.
